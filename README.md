# What is Scrollmeister?

# What is it _not_?

Scrollmeister solves a particular problem really well, but it is important to understand when _not_ to use Scrollmeister.

* Scrollmeister is not a drop-in library that you can use with your existing website. To achieve its flexibility and performance Scrollmeister needs full control over the elements of a web page. However, Scrollmeister does not lock you into its system in the sense that you can do whatever you want _inside_ of a `<element-meister>` Element.
* If you're creating a "regular" public facing website then Scrollmeister might not be the right choice. If all you need is a parallax header image then just use a jQuery plugin. Scrollmeister is meant for complex scrolling interactions spanning multiple elements, e.g. Stories or Presentations.
